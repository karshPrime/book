# Modules
modules allow the creation of blocks that may then be used as a unit.

## Entity
Interface: specifies inputs and outputs of the circuit.
```vhdl
-- basically a method in vhdl
-- instance can be called any number of time
entity two_gates is 
port ( A, B, C, D : in bit;
       E          : out bit);
end entity two_gates;
```

## Architecture
describes how the circuit works
- the **architecture** speciefies the contents of a module through the use of statements.
- it may use the ports defined in the entity and/or may use `signals` defined within the architecture 
- multiple architecture may be defiled. a common use of this is to allow the adoption of different style architectures for simulation and synthesis to hardware.
```vhdl
-- calling two_gates module here
architecture gates of two_gates is

signal C : bit;

begin
  C <= A and B after 5 ns;
  E <= C or D after 4 ns;
end architecture gates;
```

```vhdl
-- again calling two_gates module
architecture RTL of two_gates is

begin
E <= '1' when D = '1' else
     '1' when A&B == '11' else
     '0';
end architecture RTL;
```

**Generics:**<br>
useful to parametize modules, eg: allow creation of modules that can have ports of varying widths (number of bits).


## VHDL Entity & Ports
- the **entity** specifies the **interface** to the module by describing the **ports**.
- ports allow access to the module contents (a bit like pins on device)
- port directions:
  - **in**:  port is driven from outside the module
  - **out**: port is driven from inside the module
  - **inout**: port is driven ion both directions (but not at the same time)
  - **buffer**: not used; 

## Component Pins & VHDL Ports
The ports on the **top-level entity** in the hieararchy are mapped to actual pins on the ephysical implementation. <br>
**Usually require a pin assignment file that related pin numbers to port names- for example `.ucf` (user constrained file) files for xilinx FPGAs.*

## Hierarchy
a hierarchy may be created by **installing** (/calling) modules within other modules. 

## VHDL Signals
- takes the place of wires or notes in digital circuit
- changes in signals may trigger changes in other signals
- changes propagate through the 'circuit'. this may lead to ongoing changes
- may have initial values (of most use for simulation but will not be synthasised)
- for a signal to have a particular initial value, to be synthasised, the signal should be made as an assignment

examples:
```vhdl
signal limit : integer;
signal delay : time := 5 ns;
signal vec   : bit_vector(0 to 3) := "0011";
```
`:=` is how initial value is defined (for simulation).<br>
in `bit_vector(0 to 3) := "0011";` 0(most significant; 0th value) 0(1st value) 1(2nd value) 1(least significant; 3rd value). Alternatively, `bit_vector(3 downto 0) := "1100";` is more common method for same operation.


## Instantiation
to instantiate a module (similar to callign a function), a special syntax is used, for example:

`entity work.Counter.Behaviroal` indicates what module we're instantiating.  
\- `work`       : look in this <u>library</u>; default is called work. (similar to working dir)  
\- `Counter`    : defines what entity to use   
\- `Behavioral` : defines the architech
