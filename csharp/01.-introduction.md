# Introduction
Cross-Platform Object-Oriented programming language by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. 

## Features
### Object Oriented
### Type Security
The language includes a series of rules or syntax rules to control access to data types. For example, you cannot use previously uninitialized variables or you cannot make conversions of types that are not compatible with each other. 

### Garbage collector
There is no need to include object destruction instructions in the code as the CLR garbage collector will do it for us.

### Unification of types
In C# all data types are unified since they are derived from the common class System.Object.

### Efficiency
We can identify code regions with unsafe to use pointers like in C++. It can be useful when more processing speed is needed.

### Compatibility
The language syntax is very similar to C++ and Java, but we can also access Win32 API DLLs.


## .NET Core Framework
.NET Core is a free and open source framework for Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform successor to the .NET Framework.
