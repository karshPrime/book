# Kernel

## Kernel Version
Linux kernel versions are made up of the following components:
- Major Number
- Minor Number
- Revision Number

In `Linux kernel 5.18.5`, for example, the major number is 5, which indicates the major revision to the Linux Kernel. The minor number, represented by 18, indicates the minor revision and stability of the Linux Kernel. \*An odd  minor number indicates a developmental kernel, whereas an even minor number indicates a production kernel. **Developmenpmental kernels** are not fully tested and imply instability; they are tested for vulnerabilities by the people who develop Linux Software. **Production kernels** are developmental kernels that have been thoroughly tested by several Linux Developers and are declared to be stable.

Very minor changes that are commited in the Linux kernel are represented by the revision number- indicating the most current changes to the version of the particular kernel that is being released.
